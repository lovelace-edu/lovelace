Designed to replace proprietary for-profit solutions, Lovelace is a computer system designed to
get out of your way (when you want it to) and let you get on with education (whether as a student or
teacher).

## Using this (non-technical edition)

Unfortunately Lovelace is not yet ready for general use. If you'd like to help us get there, we'd
love your input on what you would like to see in the "edtech" solutions of tomorrow which you
[can provide here](https://github.com/lovelace-ed/lovelace/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Features
- **Fast** (should be at least, let us know if you're experiencing issues!)
- **No** crazy page load sizes (e.g. we won't send you the same amount of data as Pride and
Prejudice contains if you ask for a list of your lessons today).
- **Community-driven** – this isn't the plaything of a venture capitalist. This is free (as in
freedom) software that anyone can contribute to, modify and run.
- **Accessible** – the platform is designed to be usable by everyone. We're constantly working to
find new ways to accomodate people. If you can think of a way to make something more usable (or if
something confuses you) – we'd love to hear it!

## Contributions

No platform for education can be meaningful if its users are powerless to change it. We welcome all
contributors. To make this as friendly as possible:
- We have produced a document (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`) which explains the process of contributing to
Lovelace. Hopefully the doucment explains things clearly. If it doesn't though, **it's not a you**
**problem, it's an us problem**. Please let us know and we can update the document so that future
readers don't get tripped up by the same problem :D

IMPORTANT: Remember, if you think that you're "not a programmer" or "not skilled enough to
contribute" then you are **exactly** the sort of person who should be contributing. Sure, everyone
runs into problems (and often kick themselves, figuratively speaking of course, when they realise
that it was just a missing bracket) but that's not a reason to give up. We're always happy to try
and help each other solve issues – if you get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out!

## Code of conduct

Everyone participating in the project must follow the code of conduct which sets out the
expectations and guidelines for all participants. You can find a copy in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
