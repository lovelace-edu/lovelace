## Licensing code (guidelines)

**Important:** these are just guidelines – if you think something should be licensed differently,
that's fine and we'd love to discuss :D

If you're adding new code to the project, use this rule of thumb for licensing:
* If you're adding code which is part of the Lovelace application, use the AGPL-3.0
* If you're adding code which is a free-standing library (which is used inside the application),
use the MPL-2.0, *unless* the library is heavily linked to other libraries with different licenses
(e.g. if it exposes types from an MIT-licensed project in its public API it should probably be
licensed under the MIT-license)
* If you're writing documentation (e.g. user manuals, contribution guidelines, etc), use the FDL-1.3
* If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask! (you can
[ask here](https://github.com/lovelace-ed/lovelace/discussions)).
